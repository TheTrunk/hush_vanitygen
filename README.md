# hush_vanitygen NOT WORKING
Hush vanitygen - Create address you desire!
use https://github.com/TheTrunk/hushgen instead

!!!STATE: Not working properly!!! DO NOT USE!

Forked from https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen , https://github.com/exploitagency/vanitygen_z and made working for Hush.

Usage: TBD

Supports generating mainnet transparent hush addresses t1 and testnet transparent tush addresses tm.

Will never support creating generating vanity shielded addressess (z) as it is definitly not something that users looking for privacy should use.
